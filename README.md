# Stroop_Analysis
The data we worked with comes from a Stroop experiment, where reaction times (rt) were measured for different words,
which were associated with different tasks (task: such as "ink_naming" and "word_reading"), 
and under conditions of congruency (whether the word matches the color â€“ "congruent" or "incongruent").

During the study, we processed the data to include only relevant trials (e.g., removing trials with missing values or invalid reaction times),
and analyzed the reaction times of participants under different conditions of word-color congruency and task performance. 
Using graphs like stat_halfeye, we explored the distribution of reaction times across different congruency conditions and tasks.
The study aimed to investigate how differences in word-color congruency affect reaction times, 
and compared the differences between ink naming and word reading tasks
